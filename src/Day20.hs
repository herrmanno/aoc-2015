{-| Given infinite elfs {e1, e2, e2â€¦} that deliver presents to each nth house, what is
    a) the smallest housenumber, that receives *input* presents, if each elf delivers 10
       presents to each house
    b) the smallest housenumber, that receives *input* presents, if each elf delivers 11
       presents, but stops after 50 houses
